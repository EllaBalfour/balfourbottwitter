Lots went into this code, many hours were used to get it to work.
Step by step here is how I did it.
1. Learn Python, this was the longest step. Many, many weeks.
2. Make the code to be used. This meant a lot of referencing my old lessons as well as googling many questions.
3. Fix all the errors, it isn't coding without errors. This meant testing the code.
4. Downloading Python, more complicated than it sounds since I downloaded the wrong version and then had to add it to the environmental files.
5. Install Pip and Tweepy, also took more time than expected since I didn't know how to insstall directly from Command.
6. Run the code with test text. These were the tweets of malaphors posted to @BalfourBot for several days.
7. Reserach how to execute a code from online.
8. Install Heroku/Git to get the code online.
9. Git unable to execute so decide if I should try to fix it now or find a different execution program.
10. Found a new execution program, upload code and text files.
11. Run the code.
12. Done, get everyone to read the steps on Twitter.
